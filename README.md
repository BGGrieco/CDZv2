This is a website I created for Casa dello Zecchiere, a hystorical building in Milan on rent for events, art shows, 
conferences etc. 

Features fully adaptive design, with an interesting and, I like to think, innovative approach to the mobile 
version's nav menu (currently fixing minor bug on said menu).
